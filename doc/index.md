# Acme PHP

Acme PHP is a simple yet very extensible CLI client for Let's Encrypt that will help
you get and renew free HTTPS certificates.

Acme PHP is also an initiative to bring a robust, stable and powerful implementation
of the ACME protocol in PHP. Using the Acme PHP library and core components, you will be
able to deeply integrate the management of your certificates directly in your application
(for instance, renew your certificates from your web interface).
